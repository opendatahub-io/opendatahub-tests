They should consider the potential for AI to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment personalization, while also addressing risks such as algorithmic bias, the erosion of patient-clinician relationships, and the potential for breaches of privacy. Students should discuss how these factors might impact patient autonomy, informed consent, and the confidentiality of sensitive health information.\n\n"
