Here are some of the key ethical concerns:\n\n1. Bias and discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing biases and discrimination in healthcare. For example, if the training data used to develop an AI algorithm is biased towards certain demographics, the algorithm may produce biased results that disadvantage those same demographics. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes for patients.\n\n2. Lack of"
